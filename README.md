* The App was called Appple Dribbbler because it's an RSS reader for Dribbble.com, a website for designers to share their work.
* I make use of Dribbble's RSS Feed to pull in the latest projects from Dribbble, and then display them in a list view.
* Users can click into each project to see a larger version of the image:
